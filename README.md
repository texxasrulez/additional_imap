# Aditional IMAP Accounts #

**Coming Soon**

This is almost complete. Since staying at home more and keeping away from people, it has given me the time to resurrect some ancient plugins for Roundcube.  
All I have left is converting mcrypt to openssl ...  

**Check Email from an external IMAP account from within Roundcube**  

Gmail Yahoo and Hotmail are preconfigured. You can add more within the config.inc.php file.  

upload files to `/path_to_roundcube/plugins/additional_imap`  

Import SQL schema to your database located in the SQL directory of this repo.  

Rename `config.inc.php.dist` to `config.inc.php` and edit to suit your needs.  

Enable plugin via config.inc.php with

`$config['plugins'] = array('additional_imap');`

Enable from Settings - Identities Tab  

Enjoy!

I appreciate the interest in this plugin and hope all the best ...
